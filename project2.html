      <p class="description">Hero Born Custom operates as a third-person action-adventure title which requires players to gather coins for victory while fighting enemies through projectile-based combat. The game expands upon the original Hero Born project through its custom art and destructible enemies and dynamic minimap and advanced camera controls and post-processing effects.</p>

          <figcaption>Custom Item Pickups with Special Abilities: The standard item pickup system received an extension through power-up items which provide temporary special abilities such as speed boosts shield activations and enhanced jump capabilities to enhance gameplay strategy.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Dynamic Enemy Destruction System: Uses modular enemy damage logic to remove particular model components when projectiles strike enemies. The system used collision detection with distinct destructible mesh components to deliver responsive visual feedback which improved combat engagement.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>Minimap system: Implementation involved creating a real-time minimap system through Unityâ€™s secondary camera and render texture functionality. The minimap tracks player and enemy positions in real time while operating independently from the main camera to enhance navigation without main gameplay view clutter.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>Custom Third-Person Camera Controls: A third-person camera system was developed which included full 360Â° orbiting around the player, adjustable zoom levels, and smooth vertical tilt. The camera allows players to freely control their view of the environment while maintaining consistent framing of the player character, improving spatial awareness and gameplay flow.</figcaption>
